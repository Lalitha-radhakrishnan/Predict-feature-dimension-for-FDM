# Predict-feature-dimension-for-FDM
NIST's Additive Manuf benchmark was used to develop a component. Variable process settings on an FDM machine were used to create the planned benchmark component, which consisted of various geometrical elements. The CMM was used to determine the dimensions of these characteristics, and the Machine learning (ML) approach was used to forecast the dimensions and deviance
